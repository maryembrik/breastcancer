# Fixes Applied - Image Prediction Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Removed Demo Models (DenseNet, Swin Transformer, EfficientNet)
- **Problem**: Demo models were appearing in predictions even when real models were loaded
- **Fix**: 
  - Modified `_predict_with_real_models()` to filter predictions to only include `Vision Transformer` and `Magnification Aware`
  - Removed fallback to demo models when errors occur (now returns error instead)
  - Updated `predict()` method to never use demo models when `USE_REAL_MODELS=True`

### 2. ✅ Fixed Hardcoded 94.8% Accuracy
- **Problem**: Accuracy was showing hardcoded 94.8% instead of actual model accuracy
- **Fix**:
  - Removed fallback to mock data with hardcoded values in `Dashboard.jsx`
  - Now shows "N/A" when accuracy is not available (from `metrics.json`)
  - Updated `metrics.py` to return `None` for accuracy when not provided

### 3. ✅ Improved Error Handling
- **Problem**: Errors were silently falling back to demo models
- **Fix**:
  - Errors now return explicit error messages instead of demo predictions
  - Better logging and error reporting
  - Valid predictions are filtered before calculating final prediction

### 4. ✅ Updated Documentation
- Updated API endpoint docstrings to reflect actual models used
- Updated explanation text to mention Vision Transformer and Magnification Aware

## How to Use

1. **Add Your Model Metrics** (Optional):
   - Create `backend/models/image/metrics.json` with your evaluation results:
   ```json
   {
     "Vision Transformer": {
       "accuracy": 0.92,
       "f1_score": 0.91,
       "precision": 0.93,
       "recall": 0.90,
       "auc_roc": 0.95
     },
     "Magnification Aware": {
       "accuracy": 0.88,
       "f1_score": 0.87,
       "precision": 0.89,
       "recall": 0.86,
       "auc_roc": 0.90
     }
   }
   ```
   - If not provided, accuracy will show as "N/A"

2. **Check Model Loading**:
   - Run `py backend/check_models.py` to verify models are loading correctly

3. **Test Predictions**:
   - Upload a mammogram image
   - You should only see:
     - Vision Transformer predictions
     - Magnification Aware predictions
     - Ensemble (if both models predict successfully)
   - No demo models (DenseNet, Swin Transformer, etc.) should appear

## Notes

- If models predict incorrectly (e.g., malignant image predicted as benign), this is a model issue, not a code issue
- The code assumes class 0 = Benign, class 1 = Malignant for PyTorch models
- If your models use different class labels, you may need to adjust the prediction logic in `predictions.py`
